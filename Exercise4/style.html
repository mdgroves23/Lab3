            "The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the
            air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live to remember it. It began with the forging
            of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immmortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings.
            Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine Rings
            were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was
            bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for
            another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron
            forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate
            all life. One ring to rule them all."
