            My name is Old Greg, I'm a down to earth scaly man fish travelling the world with a funky ball of tits and my Husband's band.
            My story started when a man named Howard (or as I called him, Fuzzy Little Man Peach) reeled me in. Things were off to a bit of
            a rocky start. I showed him my world, my watercolors, my mangina, all things that are good.. but even so it wasn't enough for 
            Howard. We had everything we needed, but he wanted to leave every chance he got. Finally, after a few threats, a musical number, 
            a romantic dinner, and a taste of the funk, Howard came around. He agreed to take my hand in marriage and let me travel with the
            band so long as I brought along the funk and the rest was history. I became a bride, and we became the Family Funk.
